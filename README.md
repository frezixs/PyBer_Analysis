# PyBer_Analysis
## Overview of the analysis 
Perform a report of analysis of ride shareing data, including but not limited to the relationship between the type of city and 
number of drivers as well as the percentage of total drivers, total fares and total rides for each type of city. With these analysis 
we can help the python-based ride-sharing company PyBer to make furthur decisions.

From other outputs: (consider the average values)
total rides: urban > suburban > rural 
total drives: urban > suburban > rural 
total fares: urban > suburban > rural 
average fare per ride! Rural > Suburban > Urban
average fare per driver: Rural > Suburban > Urban

# Summary and recommendations 
although the total fare of rural city is the smallest, it has the largest fare per ride and fare per driver, which means 
the drivers in these areas are not enough. 
since the main income comes from urban cities, our company need to pay more attension on the service and safety of ride-sharing 
in urban cities. 
we should manage to discover more business opportunities behind rural cities.
